More data in the training set lowers bias, but then increases variance in the validation/test sets. Balancing between bias and variance with choice of these set sizes is important as we want to ensure that there is enough data to train on to get good predictions, but also want to make sure our hold-out sets are representative enough."

    "6.1    What is bias-variance tradeoff ?  Why is it relevant to machine learning problems like this one?\n",
    "According to textbook\n",
    "Answer: According to James et al. (2013), the bias-variance trade-off is the balance of two types of error: bias and variance. Bias is the differences between a model's prediction and the actual values of an observation. Variance refers to the complexiety of the model and the amount by which the predicted \"f\" would  change if estimated with a different set of observations. Since we want to minimize the mean square error, we want a model that acheives both low bias and low variance; however, this is rarely possible in real life leading to the trade-off. When fiting models, one must determine if they want to decrease bias but increase variance or vice versa. There are impications to both low bias/high variance and high bias/lower variance leading to under and overfitting, respectively. \n",
    "The bias-variance trade-off is particulary important to machine learning, such as the one posed to us in this project, as it allows us to select the model that works best given how it performs on the training and validation sets. By splitting the observations from the data into a training set (~80% of the data), validation set (~20%), and test set (~20%), we can train our various models to see how it is picking up on the nuances and patterns on a particular training set, validate the model to understand its variance and tweak the model(s) or select a new model alltogher before using it on the test set and future data to make predictions.    \n",
